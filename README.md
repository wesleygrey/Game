# Game
A top down, upgrade-based shooter game.

To design this game I followed several of the tutorials on YouTube by Abdullah Aghazadah. Specifically, several parts of my code is very similar to the code presented in the following links.

Only the basic physics of the game have been implemented. I plan to implement more levels, a boss and as the name suggests, upgrades for the Player. As of now, the Player can move, collect money, shoot bullets, take damage and die. More to come.
